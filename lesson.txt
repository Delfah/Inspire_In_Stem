This is a normal text file 
Learning python is fun
Today is a windy day

f = open("lesson.txt")
f = open("lesson.txt",'w')
      r = reading
      w = writing
      x = creating a new file
      a = opens a file for appending at the end
      t = opens the file in text mode(ability to read what is in the file)
    NB(TEXT MODS - read and write for the file )
      (binary mood - not able to read or write)
      + = able to access file
