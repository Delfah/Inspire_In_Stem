# DICTIONARIES
What are dictionaries
syntax for dictionaries
design,add,remove (in a dictionary)
looping over dictionary
dictionary in dictionaries
dictionary in list
list in dictionary


n!=(n-1)*(n=2)*(n-3)........
6!=6*5*4*3*2*1=720
4!=4*3*2*4=24
the is no factorial of negative numbetrs

draw a program that can write numbers in reverse
eg: input is 700
    output is 007

list=[]
dictionaries={}
tuples=()

functions is a block of code which gets executed together
A function inside a class in an object
__INIT__is an internal method inside a class
in function we use 'def'
  eg def sum (a,b):
       sum_nums=a+b
       print(sum_nums)
     sum(20,40) - 'calling'

palindromes
ask user to select which input to check number or letter
after user enters their inputs the program should print based on the input intered
the number entered is a palindrome 
    
            LED
An LED(Lighting Emmiting Device)- is a type of p n junction diode that works on the principle of electroluminance.
  . it is atype of semicondutor which have achieved realization through the use of high brightness.

             AVR
ARV(Aoritic Valve Replacement)- it is a state of the art solid-state stabilizer

             resistors
it is a possitive two terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
 functions of a resistor
1.reduce current flow
2.adjust signal levels
3.divide voltages
4.bias active element

           Breaddboard
  features of breadboard
1.Distribution strips are two
2.wire size is 21 to 26AWG WIRE
3.Tie points ae two hundred
4.withstanding voltage is 1000v AC
*The component used on the breadboard doesnot need any soldering to connect to the board, so it can be removed easly.
